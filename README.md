# Python Tools for Visual Studio

Welcome to our new home on github!

We're currently still working on the transfer, and with PyCon on this week it may be some time before we are fully up-and-running.

You won't necessarily be seeing the latest code at all times (though that's certainly what we intend to do eventually) and we can't accept pull requests for now. You may also notice a bit of experimentation as we figure out the best way to move our team from our old system.

Downloads of [PTVS 2.1](https://pytools.codeplex.com/releases/view/109707) and [PTVS 2.2 Beta](https://pytools.codeplex.com/releases/view/612409) are still available from CodePlex.

However, the issue tracker is open for business. So if you've encountered a problem with PTVS, please let us know [here](http://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/issues). We haven't yet decided whether we will transfer all our existing issues from CodePlex, so if you have one there that is really important to you, feel free to recreate it with a link to the original so we don't lose it.

Thank you for your patience as we settle into our new home. We hope this will result in making it easier for everyone to participate in the PTVS project.

Where is PTVS for Visual Studio "14"?
=====================================

Updating PTVS to run on Visual Studio "14" is a significant undertaking, and right now we're keen to focus on making sure that PTVS runs really well on Visual Studio 2013, 2012 and 2010.
Among other things, each release of Visual Studio "14" may have breaking changes that will require a matched version of PTVS.

The PTVS team has decided that tracking and maintaining multiple parallel releases for Visual Studio "14" is not the best use of our time right now.
We recommend obtaining Visual Studio 2013 from [visualstudio.com](http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs), and using [PTVS 2.1](https://pytools.codeplex.com/releases/view/109707).

Thank you for your interest, and rest assured that we will soon have a preview version of PTVS for Visual Studio "14".

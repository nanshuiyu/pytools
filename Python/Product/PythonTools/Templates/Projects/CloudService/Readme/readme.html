    <p>
        (These are some tips to help you get started. For more detailed
        documentation, visit
        <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=401570">our online
        documentation</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Cloud projects allow you to design an application made up of one or
        more <em>roles</em> that may be written in Python or other languages.
        An application can then be deployed to
        <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=306052">Microsoft Azure
        Cloud Service</a>, where each role will be run on one or more virtual
        machine instances, depending on your scaling settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Web roles</em> are used for web-facing front ends, and typically
        provide a HTTP or REST interface.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Worker roles</em> are used for long running tasks with no user
        interaction, and typically use Microsoft Azure
        <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=401571">data</a> and
        <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=401572">app</a>
        services.

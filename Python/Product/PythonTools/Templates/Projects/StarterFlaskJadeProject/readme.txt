To run this project, we recommended creating a virtual environment and 
installing the dependent packages in that virtual environment.
A requirements.txt listing the dependent packages is included in the project.

To create a virtual environment:
1. Open Solution Explorer.
2. Right-click on Python Environments and select Add Virtual Environment.
3. Choose a base interpreter (we recommend Python 2.7 or Python 3.4).

To install the dependent packages:
1. Open Solution Explorer.
2. Right-click on requirements.txt and select Copy Full Path.
3. Right-click on the virtual environment and select Install Python Package.
4. In the text box, type the following:
     -r "<press CTRL-V to paste full path to requirements.txt>"

For an improved Jade editing experience, we recommend installing Node.js Tools
for Visual Studio (http://nodejstools.codeplex.com), from the same team that
brought you PTVS.

NTVS includes a generic Jade editor extension, available in the context of any
project type (Node.js, Python, C#, etc).

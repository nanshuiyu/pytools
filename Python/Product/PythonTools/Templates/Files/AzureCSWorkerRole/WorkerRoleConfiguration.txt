To finish configuring your woker role, ensure the following items have been
added to your ServiceDefinition.csdef file.

<ServiceDefinition ...>
  <WorkerRole ...>
    ...
    <Startup>
      <Task commandLine="bin\ps.cmd ConfigureCloudService.ps1" executionContext="elevated" taskType="simple">
        <Environment>
          <Variable name="EMULATED">
            <RoleInstanceValue xpath="/RoleEnvironment/Deployment/@emulated"/>
          </Variable>
        </Environment>
      </Task>
    </Startup>
    <Runtime>
      <Environment>
        <Variable name="EMULATED">
          <RoleInstanceValue xpath="/RoleEnvironment/Deployment/@emulated"/>
        </Variable>
      </Environment>
      <EntryPoint>
        <ProgramEntryPoint commandLine="bin\ps.cmd LaunchWorker.ps1" setReadyOnProcessStart="true" />
      </EntryPoint>
    </Runtime>


This file can be safely deleted once your configuration has been updated.

Troubleshooting Worker Role Deployment
======================================

If your worker role does not behave correctly after deployment, check the following:

1. Your Python project includes a bin\ folder with (at least):
   - ConfigureCloudService.ps1
   - LaunchWorker.ps1
   - ps.cmd

2. Your Cloud project includes the above XML and the command lines match.

3. Your Python project includes either:
   - a requirements.txt file listing all dependencies, OR
   - a virtual environment containing all dependencies.
   
   ConfigureCloudService.ps1 will not install from requirements.txt into a
   virtual environment (but you can of course modify the script to do this if
   you need it).

4. Enable Remote Desktop on your Cloud Service and investigate the log files.

   Logs for ConfigureCloudService.ps1 and LaunchWorker.ps1 are stored in the
   following path on the machine instance:
   
   C:\Resources\Directory\%RoleId%.DiagnosticStore\LogFiles

   Currently, the LaunchWorker.ps1 log is the only way to view any output
   or errors displayed by your Python program.

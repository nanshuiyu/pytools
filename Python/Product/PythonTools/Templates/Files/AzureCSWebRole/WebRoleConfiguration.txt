To finish configuring your web role, ensure the following item has been added to
your ServiceDefinition.csdef file.

    <Startup>
      <Task commandLine="ps.cmd ConfigureCloudService.ps1" executionContext="elevated" taskType="simple">
        <Environment>
          <Variable name="EMULATED">
            <RoleInstanceValue xpath="/RoleEnvironment/Deployment/@emulated"/>
          </Variable>
        </Environment>
      </Task>
    </Startup>

This file can be safely deleted once your configuration has been updated.
